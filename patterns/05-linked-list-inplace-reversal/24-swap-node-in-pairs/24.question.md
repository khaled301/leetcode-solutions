## Leet Code 287: Find The Duplicate Number
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = []

Output: []
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1]

Output: [1]
```

Example 4:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3]

Output: [2,1,3]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Input Linked List
Initial state of the list:  
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`

A dummy node is added to simplify edge cases:  
`0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`

| **Line**                             | **Action/Values**                          |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Initialization**                   |                                           |
| `dummy.next = head`                  | List becomes `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`. |
| `prev = dummy`                       | `prev` points to `0`.                     |
| **Iteration 1 (Swapping 1 and 2)**   |                                           |
| `first = prev.next`                  | `first` points to `1`.                    |
| `second = prev.next.next`            | `second` points to `2`.                   |
| `first.next = second.next`           | `1.next = 3` → `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`. |
| `second.next = first`                | `2.next = 1` → `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`. |
| `prev.next = second`                 | `0.next = 2` → `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> None`. |
| `prev = first`                       | `prev` points to `1`.                     |
| **Iteration 2 (Swapping 3 and 4)**   |                                           |
| `first = prev.next`                  | `first` points to `3`.                    |
| `second = prev.next.next`            | `second` points to `4`.                   |
| `first.next = second.next`           | `3.next = None` → `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> None`. |
| `second.next = first`                | `4.next = 3` → `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> None`. |
| `prev.next = second`                 | `1.next = 4` → `0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> None`. |
| `prev = first`                       | `prev` points to `3`.                     |

### Final Output
- The loop ends when `prev.next` or `prev.next.next` is `None`.
- The final linked list is:  
  `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> None`

### Summary of Key Steps
1. Use a dummy node to simplify the swapping process.
2. Traverse the list in pairs, using `prev`, `first`, and `second` pointers.
3. Update pointers in the following order:
   - Adjust `first.next` to point to the node after the pair.
   - Adjust `second.next` to point to `first`.
   - Adjust `prev.next` to point to `second`.
4. Move `prev` to `first` to prepare for the next pair.


### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the swapPairs function is **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the function is **O(1)**, because:

-   The function uses only a constant amount of extra space for the dummy, prev, first, and second pointers.
-   The swapping is done in-place, and no additional data structures (such as arrays or lists) are used.
