## Leet Code 287: Find The Duplicate Number

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
```

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Breakdown of the Solution:

**Base Case Check**: 
If the list is empty (head is None) or has only one node (head.next is None), return the head as is.

**Initialization**:

prev is set to None (to mark the end of the reversed list).
curr is set to the head (to traverse the list).

**Reversal Loop**:

- Save the next node (next = curr.next) to not lose the reference.
- Reverse the link (curr.next = prev).
- Move prev to the current node (prev = curr) and curr to the next node (curr = next).

**Return**: 

When the loop finishes (curr becomes None), prev is the new head of the reversed list.

**Time Complexity**:

O(n): Each node is visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity**:

O(1): Only a constant amount of extra space is used (pointers prev, curr, and next).

## Recursive Solution:
**Base Case**:

If head is None or only one node remains (head.next is None), return head as the new head of the reversed list.

**Recursive Call**:

Reverse the rest of the list starting from head.next. The result of the recursive call (reversed_head) is the new head of the reversed list.

**Reverse the Links**:

After returning from recursion, make the next node (head.next) point back to the current node (head) by setting head.next.next = head.

**Break the Old Link**:

Set head.next = None to avoid cycles in the list.

**Return the New Head**:

reversed_head is returned as the new head of the reversed list.


## Recursive Steps to Reverse a Linked List


### Initial Linked List:
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`

| **Step** | **Function Call**   | **What Happens**                                               | **Return Value**                | **Action**                               | **Where is `head`?**           |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1**    | `reverseList(1)`    | Calls `reverseList(2)`.                                         | Waits for `reverseList(2)`      | Move into the next recursion.            | `head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` |
| **2**    | `reverseList(2)`    | Calls `reverseList(3)`.                                         | Waits for `reverseList(3)`      | Move into the next recursion.            | `head = 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`      |
| **3**    | `reverseList(3)`    | Calls `reverseList(4)`.                                         | Waits for `reverseList(4)`      | Move into the next recursion.            | `head = 3 -> 4 -> 5`           |
| **4**    | `reverseList(4)`    | Calls `reverseList(5)`.                                         | Waits for `reverseList(5)`      | Move into the next recursion.            | `head = 4 -> 5`                |
| **5**    | `reverseList(5)`    | `head.next is None`, so it returns `5`.                        | Returns `5 -> None`             | Base case reached. Start unwinding.      | `head = 5 -> None`             |
| **6**    | Return to `4`       | Sets `head.next.next = head` (`5 -> 4`), `head.next = None`.   | Returns `5 -> 4 -> None`        | Links `5 -> 4`, removes `4 -> 5`.        | `head = 4 -> None`             |
| **7**    | Return to `3`       | Sets `head.next.next = head` (`4 -> 3`), `head.next = None`.   | Returns `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> None`   | Links `4 -> 3`, removes `3 -> 4`.        | `head = 3 -> None`             |
| **8**    | Return to `2`       | Sets `head.next.next = head` (`3 -> 2`), `head.next = None`.   | Returns `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> None` | Links `3 -> 2`, removes `2 -> 3`.        | `head = 2 -> None`             |
| **9**    | Return to `1`       | Sets `head.next.next = head` (`2 -> 1`), `head.next = None`.   | Returns `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None` | Links `2 -> 1`, removes `1 -> 2`.        | `head = 1 -> None`             |

---

### Final Result:
The linked list is now reversed:

`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None`

---

### Key Observations:

`head` represents the **current node being processed** in that recursive frame.

1. **Base Case**: When `head.next is None`, the recursion stops, and the last node becomes the new head of the reversed list.
2. **Unwinding Phase**:
   - Each recursive return reverses a single link.
   - `head.next.next = head` reverses the link direction.
   - `head.next = None` removes the old forward link.
3. The final `head` is the original start of the list (`1 -> None`), while the return value becomes the **new head** of the reversed list (`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None`).
4. The recursion stack depth is proportional to the number of nodes (`n`), resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(n)** due to the stack.

---

**Time Complexity**:

O(n): Each node is visited once during the recursion.

**Space Complexity**:

O(n): The recursion stack can go up to n levels deep for a list of size n.
