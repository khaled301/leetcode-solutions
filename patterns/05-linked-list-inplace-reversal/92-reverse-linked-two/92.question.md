## Leet Code 92: Reverse Linked List II

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, ***reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right***, and return the reversed list.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= n <= 500
-500 <= Node.val <= 500
1 <= left <= right <= n
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Edge Case Handling:

```python
if not head or not head.next:
    return head
```
If the list is empty or has only one node, there's nothing to reverse, so the function returns the head as it is.

### Initialization:

```python
currentPosition = 0
dummy = ListNode(0)
dummy.next = head
currentNode = dummy
```
**currentPosition**: Tracks the current node's position in the list.
**dummy**: A dummy node that points to the head of the list, used to simplify edge cases.

**currentNode**: Initialized to the dummy node.

### Traverse to the Node Before left:

```python
while currentNode:
    if (currentPosition + 1) != left:
        currentPosition += 1
        currentNode = currentNode.next
    else:
        beforeLeftNode = currentNode
        leftAsStartNode = currentNode.next
        currentNode = currentNode.next
        currentPosition += 1
        previousNode = None
        while currentPosition <= right:
            next = currentNode.next
            currentNode.next = previousNode
            previousNode = currentNode
            currentNode = next
            if currentPosition == right:
                beforeLeftNode.next = previousNode
                leftAsStartNode.next = next
            currentPosition += 1
        break
```
This loop traverses the list until it reaches the node just before the position left.

**eforeLeftNode**: The node just before the node at position left.

**leftAsStartNode**: The node at position left.

### Reverse the Sublist:

Once currentNode is positioned just before left, the inner loop reverses the sublist from left to right.

### Inner Loop Steps:

-  next = currentNode.next: Save the next node.

-  currentNode.next = previousNode: Reverse the current node's next pointer.

-  previousNode = currentNode: Move previousNode one step forward.

-  currentNode = next: Move currentNode one step forward.

-  When currentPosition == right, link beforeLeftNode to the new head of the reversed sublist (previousNode) and leftAsStartNode to the node after the reversed sublist (next).

### Return the New Head:

```python
return dummy.next
```
The modified list starts from dummy.next, which accounts for any changes made.

### Detailed Example

Let's walk through an example where the list is 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 and we want to reverse from left = 2 to right = 7.

**Initial List**: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9

**Traverse to Node Before left**: Position the pointers to just before node 2.

### Inner Loop Execution:

Reverse the sublist 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.

### After reversal:

1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9

### Summary
The function reverses the sublist in-place by adjusting the next pointers of the nodes in the specified range.

It uses a dummy node to handle edge cases and simplifies the logic for connecting the reversed sublist back to the main list.

The main loop traverses to the sublist starting point, and the inner loop performs the reversal.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the reverseBetween function can be evaluated by examining the loops and operations performed:

**Initial Traversal to the Node Before left**:

The while loop traverses the list until it reaches the node just before left, which takes O(left) time.

**Reversing the Sublist**:

The inner loop reverses the nodes from left to right. This loop runs for (right - left + 1) iterations, which takes O(right - left + 1) time.

Therefore, the total time complexity is:

**𝑂 ( 𝑛 )**

where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the function may traverse the entire list in the worst case.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the reverseBetween function can be evaluated by examining the additional space used:

**Dummy Node**:

A single dummy node is created, which takes O(1) space.

**Pointer Variables**:

A few pointer variables are used (e.g., currentNode, beforeLeftNode, leftAsStartNode, previousNode, next), which all take O(1) space.

Therefore, the total space complexity is:

**𝑂 ( 1 )**

The function uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input list.
