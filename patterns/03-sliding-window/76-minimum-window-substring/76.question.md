## Leet Code 167: Two Sum 2 - Input Array Is Sorted
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
```

Follow up:

```plaintext
Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
```
