## Leet Code 167: Two Sum 2 - Input Array Is Sorted
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
```

Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

## Breakdown of the Solution:

# Minimum Window Substring

## Description

This implementation finds the smallest substring in string `s` that contains all characters of string `t` using a **dynamic sliding window technique**. It ensures efficiency by maintaining two hashmaps (or dictionaries): one for the target character frequencies (`countT`) and another for the current window frequencies (`window`).

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `countT` to store frequencies of characters in `t`.
   - `window` to track frequencies of characters in the current window of `s`.
   - `have` and `need` to manage the count of satisfied characters.
   - `res` to store the bounds of the smallest substring.
2. **Expand Window**:
   - Traverse `s` with the right pointer (`r`), expanding the window.
   - If a character matches frequency requirements, increment `have`.
3. **Shrink Window**:
   - When all required characters are satisfied (`have == need`), shrink the window from the left (`l`) to minimize its size.
   - Update the result if the current window is smaller than the previously found one.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Return an empty string if no valid substring exists.
