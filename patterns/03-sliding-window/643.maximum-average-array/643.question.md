## Leet Code 643: Maximum Average Subarray (1)
You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,4,0,3,2], k = 1
Output: 04.00
Explanation: Maximum average is (4) / 1 = 4
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
n == nums.length
1 <= k <= n <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Initialization:

currentSum is initialized to the sum of the first k elements (same as maxSum).

### Sliding Window:

In the loop, currentSum is updated by subtracting the element that slides out of the window (nums[i]) and adding the element that slides into the window (nums[i + k]).

maxSum is updated with the maximum value between the current maxSum and currentSum.

### Returning the Average:

Finally, return the average by dividing maxSum by k.
