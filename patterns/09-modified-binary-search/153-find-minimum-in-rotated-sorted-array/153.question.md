## Leet Code 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` `1` time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

## Approach

This solution leverages the properties of a rotated sorted array and employs **binary search** to identify the minimum element in \(O(\log n)\) time. The algorithm splits the array into two regions:
1. **False Region**: All elements are greater than the last element of the array.
2. **True Region**: All elements are less than or equal to the last element of the array.

The binary search narrows the range of the array until the left and right pointers converge on the minimum element.

**Using this**:

We are effectively dividing the array into two regions:

- `False` region: Elements where `nums[m] > nums[r]`.
- `True` region: Elements where `nums[m] <= nums[r]`.

The ***goal*** is to transition from the `False` region to the `True` region, as the `pivot` (minimum element) is the ***first*** element in the `True` region.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: The algorithm divides the array into halves in each iteration.
- For an array of size \(n\), the number of divisions is \(O(\log n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\).

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.
- No additional data structures are used.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\).

## Key Insights

1. The **True-False Concept**:
   - The array is divided into a "False" region (`nums[i] > nums[r]`) and a "True" region (`nums[i] <= nums[r]`).
   - The minimum element is the first element in the True region.

2. **Pivot Point**:
   - The transition from the False region to the True region marks the pivot point, which is the minimum element.

3. **Termination**:
   - The binary search terminates when the left and right pointers converge, ensuring that the minimum element is located.

## How Binary Search Uses True-False:
Now, let’s see how binary search works step by step, leveraging the True-False concept.

```plaintext
Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
```

Initial State:
```plaintext
l = 0, r = 6, nums[r] = 2.
Array: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
True/False: [False, False, False, False, True, True, True]
```

Step 1:
```plaintext
Compute m = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3, nums[m] = 7.
Compare: nums[m] > nums[r] → 7 > 2 → False.
Action: Move l = m + 1 → l = 4.
```

Step 2:
```plaintext
Now l = 4, r = 6, True/False: [False, False, False, False, True, True, True]
Compute m = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5, nums[m] = 1.
Compare: nums[m] <= nums[r] → 1 <= 2 → True.
Action: Move r = m → r = 5, update idx = 5.
```

Step 3:
```plaintext
Now l = 4, r = 5, True/False: [False, False, False, False, True, True, True]
Compute m = (4 + 5) // 2 = 4, nums[m] = 0.
Compare: nums[m] <= nums[r] → 0 <= 2 → True.
Action: Move r = m → r = 4, update idx = 4.
```

Step 4:
```plaintext
Now l = 4, r = 4.
Termination: l == r, and nums[l] = nums[idx] = 0.
```


Here, the last element is `nums[r] = 2`. We compare each element with `nums[r]` and mark it as `True` or `False`:

| Index | nums[i] | Compare with nums[r] | True/False |
|-------|---------|-----------------------|------------|
| 0     | 4       | 4 > 2                | False      |
| 1     | 5       | 5 > 2                | False      |
| 2     | 6       | 6 > 2                | False      |
| 3     | 7       | 7 > 2                | False      |
| 4     | 0       | 0 <= 2               | True       |
| 5     | 1       | 1 <= 2               | True       |
| 6     | 2       | 2 <= 2               | True       |

### Observations

- The **False region** (`nums[i] > nums[r]`) is located before the pivot:

`[4, 5, 6, 7]`
- The **True region** (`nums[i] <= nums[r]`) starts at the pivot and continues to the end:

[0, 1, 2]
- The transition from False to True occurs at the **pivot**, which is where the minimum element resides.

### Key Takeaway

By leveraging this True-False division, the algorithm narrows down the search to locate the minimum element in \(O(\log n)\).



## Edge Cases

- **Single Element Array**: Directly return the single element.
- **Already Sorted Array**: The minimum is the first element.
- **Full Rotation (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4])**: Handled naturally by the binary search logic.
