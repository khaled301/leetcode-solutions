## Leet Code 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:
### Approach

Given the properties of the array, it's tempting to perform a linear search. However, that would result in a time complexity of O(n). Instead, we can use the properties of the array to our advantage and apply a binary search to find the target with time complexity of O(logn) only.

### Treating the Rotated Array

Although the array is rotated, it retains some properties of sorted arrays that we can leverage. Specifically, one half of the array (either the left or the right) will always be sorted. This means we can still apply binary search by determining which half of our array is sorted and whether the target lies within it.

### Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

### Initialization

We start with two pointers:

left - This represents the beginning of the array. We initialize it to 0, the index of the first element.
right - This represents the end of the array. It's set to n−1, the index of the last element, where n is the length of the array.

### Iterative Binary Search

We perform the binary search within a while loop until left exceeds right. In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint between left and right.

### Deciding the Sorted Half:

At any point during the search in the rotated array, one half (either the left or the right) will always be sorted. Determining which half is sorted is crucial for our modified binary search.

If left half [low...mid] is sorted: We know this if the element at low is less than or equal to the element at mid. In a normally sorted array, if the start is less than or equal to the midpoint, it means all elements till the midpoint are in the correct increasing order.

If the target lies within this sorted left half: We know this if the target is greater than or equal to the element at low and less than the element at mid. If this is the case, we then move our search to this half, meaning, we update high to mid−1.

**Otherwise**: The target must be in the right half. So, we update low to mid+1.

If right half [mid...high] is sorted: This is the else part. If the left half isn't sorted, the right half must be!

If the target lies within this sorted right half: We know this if the target is greater than the element at mid and less than or equal to the element at high. If so, we move our search to this half by updating low to mid+1.

**Otherwise**: The target must be in the left half. So, we update high to mid−1.

### Rationale:

The beauty of this approach lies in its ability to determine with certainty which half of the array to look in, even though the array is rotated. By checking which half of the array is sorted and then using the sorted property to determine if the target lies in that half, we can effectively eliminate half of the array from consideration at each step, maintaining the O(logn) time complexity of the binary search.

## Complexity
### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity is O(logn) since we're performing a binary search over the elements of the array.

### Space Complexity: 
The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables (left, right, mid), regardless of the size of the input array.
