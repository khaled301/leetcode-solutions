## Leet Code 240: Search a 2D Matrix II

Write an **efficient algorithm** that searches for a value `target` in an `m` X `n` integer matrix `matrix`. This `matrix` has the following properties:

-  Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from - left to right.
-  Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
-109 <= target <= 109
```

## Breakdown of the Solution [EFFICIENT APPROACH -> O ( M + N )]:

It is import to determine the starting point of the search depending on the requirements of the problem.

1. As the rows are sorted -> matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j+1]
2. As the columns are sorted -> matrix[i][j] >matrix[i-1][j]

**Hence it can be said that** :

- any element right to `matrix[i][j]` will be greater than it.
- any element to the top of `matrix[i][j]` will be less than it.

**So we start searching from BOTTOM_LEFT**:

-  if element found -> return `TRUE`
-  if `matrix[i][j] > target` -> move `UP`.
-  if `matrix[i][j] < target` -> move `RIGHT`.

**BOTTOM_LEFT** because of the following reasons:

- The position has distinct properties
   - On it's right the values will be greater than the current element.
      - as the rows are sorted -> `matrix[i][j] < matrix[i][j+1]`

   - On it's top the values will be less than the current element.
      - as the columns are sorted -> `matrix[i][j] >matrix[i-1][j]`.


## Time Complexity Analysis of the Efficient Algorithm

### Steps in the Algorithm

#### 1) Starting Point:
- The search begins at the bottom-left corner of the matrix, at position (m-1, 0).

#### 2) While Loop:
- The loop continues while the indices \(i\) (row) and \(j\) (column) are within valid bounds:
  - \(i\) starts at \(m-1\) (last row) and decreases.
  - \(j\) starts at 0 (first column) and increases.

#### 3) Key Operations:
- Each comparison either:
  - Moves up one row (\(i -= 1\)) if the current element is greater than the target.
  - Moves right one column (\(j += 1\)) if the current element is less than the target.

#### 4) Number of Steps:
- At most, the algorithm makes:
  - \(m\) moves up (from the last row to the first row).
  - \(n\) moves right (from the first column to the last column).

### Time Complexity:
- In the worst case, the algorithm visits at most \(m + n\) elements (one move per step).
- Therefore, the time complexity is:
  \[
  O(m + n)
  \]

### Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like \(i\) and \(j\).
- Therefore, the space complexity is:
  \[
  O(1)
  \]

### Why This Works:
- The matrix is sorted:
  - Each row is sorted in ascending order.
  - Each column is sorted in ascending order.
- Starting at the bottom-left corner ensures that:
  - Moving up encounters smaller elements.
  - Moving right encounters larger elements.

## Time Complexity Analysis of the second Algorithm

### 1) Outer Loop:
- The outer loop iterates over each row in the matrix.
- If the matrix has \(m\) rows, this loop runs \(m\) times.

### 2) Inner Binary Search:
- For each row, a binary search is performed.
- If each row has \(n\) columns, binary search takes \(O(\log n)\) time.

### Overall Time Complexity:
- For each row (\(m\)), the binary search runs \(O(\log n)\).
- The total time complexity is:
  \[
  O(m \cdot \log n)
  \]


## O(m+n) vs O(m log n) Comparison

### 1) Understanding the Complexities:

- **\(O(m + n)\)**:
  - This arises from searching a sorted matrix by starting at one corner and moving diagonally through the matrix.
  - In the worst case, we traverse at most \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns.

- **\(O(m \log n)\)**:
  - This arises when performing a binary search on each of the \(m\) rows.
  - Binary search takes \(O(\log n)\) per row, and there are \(m\) rows, resulting in \(O(m \log n)\).

### 2) Which Is Better?

- **When \(m\) and \(n\) are comparable**:
  - \(O(m + n)\) is often faster because it avoids multiple logarithmic searches.
  - For example, if \(m = n = 1000\), then \(O(m + n) = 2000\), while \(O(m \log n) = 1000 \cdot 10 = 10000\).

- **When \(n\) is significantly larger than \(m\)**:
  - \(O(m \log n)\) is better because the logarithmic factor grows much slower than \(n\).
  - For example, if \(m = 10\) and \(n = 10^6\), then \(O(m + n) = 10^6 + 10 \approx 10^6\), while \(O(m \log n) = 10 \cdot 20 = 200\).

### 3) Conclusion:

- **Use \(O(m + n)\)** if:
  - The matrix dimensions are close to each other, or \(n\) is not excessively large.

- **Use \(O(m \log n)\)** if:
  - \(n\) is much larger than \(m\), making binary search significantly faster on the wider dimension.

In practical applications, the choice depends on the matrix dimensions and performance requirements.
