## Leet Code 74: Search a 2D Matrix

You are given an `m` X `n` integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in matrix or `false` otherwise.

**You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.**

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:
### Identify Target Row:

Perform binary search on the rows of the matrix to narrow down the range where the `target` could exist.
This reduces the search space from `𝑚` rows to a single row.

### Search Within the Row:

Use binary search again on the selected row to find the `target`.
This reduces the search space from `𝑛` elements to the exact location of the `target` (if it exists).

### Return Result:

If the `target` is found in the row, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

## Time Complexity Analysis:
### Row Selection (Outer Binary Search):

Performing a binary search on the rows of the matrix to narrow down the range where the `target` could exist.
This step operates on the number of rows, `𝑚`, and requires `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑚 )` comparisons.

### Column Selection (Inner Binary Search):

After selecting the correct row using the first binary search, perform another binary search within that row to find the target.
Each row has `𝑛` columns, and this binary search takes `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 )` comparisons.

### Total Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm combines these two steps: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑚 ) + 𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 )` 
Since logarithms are additive, this simplifies to: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⋅ 𝑛 ) )`

## Summary:
**Time Complexity**: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⋅ 𝑛 ) )` 
**Space Complexity**: `𝑂 ( 1 )`, as no additional data structures are used.


## Approach 2 (searchMatrixOptimal):
### Key Explanation Points
1. `mid_row, mid_col = divmod(mid, n)`:

   - **Purpose**: Converts the 1D index mid into 2D matrix indices (row, column).

   - **How it Works**:
      - `mid` is the index as if the matrix were flattened into a 1D array.
      - `divmod(mid, n)` splits `mid` into:
         - `mid_row = mid // n`: The row index.
         - `mid_col = mid % n`: The column index.

2. `matrix[mid_row][mid_col]`:

   - Purpose: Accesses the value in the matrix at the computed row and column.
   - The 2D index (mid_row, mid_col) pinpoints the exact position of the target in the matrix.

### Overall Explanation:

- Treat the matrix as a flattened 1D array of size 𝑚 × 𝑛
- Perform binary search on this virtual 1D array using left and right pointers.
- Use divmod to map the 1D index to the 2D matrix indices for comparison.
- Narrow down the search space by updating left or right until the target is found or the pointers cross.

### Breakdown of mid_row and mid_col Calculation:
**Input `2D` representation**:
[[1, 3, 5], [7, 9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]

**Input representation after flattening to `1D`**:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]

For `mid = 4 mid=4, and 𝑛 = 3 n=3`:

- **Row Calculation**: `mid // n = 4 // 3 = 1` .
   - The index `4` is in row `1` because the first `3` elements (row 0) are already filled.

- **Column Calculation**: `mid % n = 4 % 3 = 1`.
   - The index `4` is the `2nd` element (0-based) in row `1`.

This gives us `matrix[1][1]`.

***Why This Works***?
The division `//` calculates how many full rows fit into the index, while the modulus `%` finds the leftover column position within the current row. This systematic conversion ensures correct mapping from the 1D virtual array back to the 2D matrix.

### Time Complexity:

Binary Search on `𝑚 × 𝑛` elements: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⋅ 𝑛 ) )`.

### Space Complexity:

`𝑂 ( 1 )`, as no extra data structures are used.
