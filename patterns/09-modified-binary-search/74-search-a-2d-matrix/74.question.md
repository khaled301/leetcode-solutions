## Leet Code 74: Search a 2D Matrix

You are given an `m` X `n` integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in matrix or `false` otherwise.

**You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.**

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:
### Identify Target Row:

Perform binary search on the rows of the matrix to narrow down the range where the `target` could exist.
This reduces the search space from `𝑚` rows to a single row.

### Search Within the Row:

Use binary search again on the selected row to find the `target`.
This reduces the search space from `𝑛` elements to the exact location of the `target` (if it exists).

### Return Result:

If the `target` is found in the row, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

## Time Complexity Analysis:
### Row Selection (Outer Binary Search):

Performing a binary search on the rows of the matrix to narrow down the range where the `target` could exist.
This step operates on the number of rows, `𝑚`, and requires `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑚 )` comparisons.

### Column Selection (Inner Binary Search):

After selecting the correct row using the first binary search, perform another binary search within that row to find the target.
Each row has `𝑛` columns, and this binary search takes `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 )` comparisons.

### Total Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm combines these two steps: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑚 ) + 𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑛 )` 
Since logarithms are additive, this simplifies to: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⋅ 𝑛 ) )`

## Summary:
**Time Complexity**: `𝑂 ( log ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⋅ 𝑛 ) )` 
**Space Complexity**: `𝑂 ( 1 )`, as no additional data structures are used.
