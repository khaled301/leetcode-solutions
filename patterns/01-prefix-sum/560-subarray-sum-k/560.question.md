## Leet Code 560: Subarray Sum Equals K
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2 

 
Output: 2 => ( a[0] + a[1] = 2 ) &( a[1]+a[2] = 2 )
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2 => ( a[0] + a[1] = 3 ) & ( a[2] = 3 )
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-107 <= k <= 107
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Initialization:

-   res = 0: To keep count of the number of subarrays that sum to K.

-   curSum = 0: To store the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array.

-   prefixSums = {0: 1}: A dictionary to store the cumulative sums and their frequencies, starting with {0: 1} to account for the sum being equal to K from the start.

### Iterate through the array:

-   curSum += num: Update the cumulative sum.

-   diff = curSum - k: Calculate the difference needed to find a subarray that sums to K.

-   res += prefixSums.get(diff, 0): If diff is in prefixSums, add its count to res. This means there are prefixSums[diff] subarrays ending at the current index that sum to K.

-   prefixSums[curSum] = 1 + prefixSums.get(curSum, 0): Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum in the dictionary.

### Return the result:

-   return res: The total number of subarrays that sum to K.

### Time Complexity:
This function efficiently finds the number of subarrays that sum to K in linear time, O(n), which is optimal for this problem.


### Additional Info:
#### When to check currentSum == K:
This is to determine if the cumulative sum up to the current element directly equals K. If it does, it means we have found a subarray from the start of the array up to the current element that sums to K.

#### When to check currentSum - K:
This is to determine if there are previous subarrays that, when added together with some elements, form a subarray that sums to K. Specifically, this step checks if thereâ€™s a previous cumulative sum such that the difference between the current cumulative sum and this previous sum is K. If cum_sum - K exists in the dictionary, it means there are subarrays ending at the current index that sum to K.
