## Leet Code 525: Contiguous Subarray
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Consideration:
-   How to know to shrink window or increase?
    -   Have to split, thus recursive and worse than O(n^2)

-   Not every result starts at beginning, e.g. 111 00

-   Is it possible to know exactly where the first 1 was, and verify that after it ?
-   count[1] === count[0]?


### Plan:
We will track total number of Ones "1s" and Zeros "0s" as well as the difference between total Ones "1s" and
Zeros "0s" (C["1"] - C["0"]) at every index.


### Algorithm and Inner Logic
The algorithm follows a pattern where it uses the difference between the counts of 1s and 0s (tracked as ones - zeros) to detect subarrays with equal counts of 1s and 0s. The algorithm can be broken down into a few key steps.

#### Initialize Counters: 
ones, zeros, and max_length are initialized to zero. diff_index is an empty dictionary that will map each unique ones - zeros difference to the first index where it occurs.

#### Iterate Through Each Element in nums:

For each element in nums, the code increments ones if the element is 1, or increments zeros if it is 0.
The difference ones - zeros is calculated for the current index. This difference represents the "balance state" at that point.

Check Conditions for Subarrays with Equal 1s and 0s:

#### Case 1: Entire Array Up to This Index is Balanced:

If ones equals zeros, then from the start to the current index, the subarray has an equal number of 1s and 0s. So, max_length is set to ones + zeros.

#### Case 2: Matching Balance State in diff_index:

If ones - zeros is found in diff_index, it means a previous index had the same balance state, implying that the subarray between that previous index and the current index is balanced. The length of this subarray is i - idx, and if it's longer than the current max_length, it updates max_length.

#### Case 3: New Balance State:

If ones - zeros is not in diff_index, it stores this difference with the current index. This allows tracking the earliest occurrence of each unique balance state.

#### Return the Maximum Length: 
After processing all elements, max_length holds the length of the longest balanced subarray.

### Tabular Simulation

Let's walk through an example with nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1].

#### Simulation of Algorithm with Example Input

Let's walk through an example with `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.

| Index (`i`) | `num` | `zeros` | `ones` | `ones - zeros` | `diff_index`           | `max_length` | Explanation                                                                                   |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0           | 0     | 1       | 0      | -1            | `{ -1: 0 }`             | 0            | New balance state `-1` stored at index `0`.                                                  |
| 1           | 1     | 1       | 1      | 0             | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1 }`       | 2            | `ones == zeros`, so from index `0` to `1`, subarray is balanced (`[0, 1]`).                  |
| 2           | 0     | 2       | 1      | -1            | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1 }`       | 2            | `ones - zeros = -1` found at index `0`. Subarray `[1, 0, 1]` is balanced, length `2`.        |
| 3           | 1     | 2       | 2      | 0             | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1 }`       | 4            | `ones == zeros`, subarray from `0` to `3` is balanced (`[0, 1, 0, 1]`), length `4`.          |
| 4           | 0     | 3       | 2      | -1            | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1 }`       | 4            | `ones - zeros = -1` at index `0`, subarray `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]` is balanced, length `4`.        |
| 5           | 1     | 3       | 3      | 0             | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1 }`       | 6            | `ones == zeros`, subarray from `0` to `5` is balanced (`[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`), length `6`.    |
| 6           | 1     | 3       | 4      | 1             | `{ -1: 0, 0: 1, 1: 6 }` | 6            | New balance state `1` stored at index `6`.                                                   |

### Final Output

After processing all elements, `max_length` is `6`, which represents the longest balanced subarray (`[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`).
