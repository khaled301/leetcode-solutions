## Leet Code 303: Range Sum Query

Given an integer array nums, handle multiple queries of the following type:
-   Calculate the sum of the elements of nums between indices left and right inclusive where left <= right.

Implement the NumArray class:

-   NumArray(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
-   int sumRange(int left, int right) Returns the sum of the elements of nums between indices left and right inclusive (i.e. nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]).

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input
["NumArray", "sumRange", "sumRange", "sumRange"]
[[[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]], [0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]]
Output
[null, 1, -1, -3]

Explanation
NumArray numArray = new NumArray([-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1
numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -3
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
0 <= left <= right < nums.length
At most 104 calls will be made to sumRange.
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:
The NumArray class is designed to efficiently calculate the sum of elements within a specific range in an integer array. It achieves this by precomputing prefix sums, allowing sumRange queries to be answered in constant time, O(1).

### Initialization (__init__ method):

When the NumArray object is initialized, the class constructs an array of prefix sums based on the input nums.
This array, stored as self.prefix_sums, contains cumulative sums where each element at index i represents the sum of all elements in nums up to index i.
This preprocessing enables fast lookups for range sums.

### Prefix Sum Calculation (prefixSum method):

This helper function iterates through the input array nums to transform it into a prefix sum array.
Each element at index i in nums is updated to hold the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index i, effectively storing cumulative sums.

### Range Sum Calculation (sumRange method):

Given a left and right index, this method returns the sum of elements in nums between these indices (inclusive).
The sum of any subarray can be computed using the difference of prefix sums:
If left is greater than 0, the sum of elements from left to right is self.prefix_sums[right] - self.prefix_sums[left - 1].
If left is 0, the range sum is simply self.prefix_sums[right] (the sum from the beginning up to right).


### Algorithm Logic for sumRange
The sumRange method works by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums:

-   When left > 0: To find the sum from index left to right, the method subtracts the prefix sum at left - 1 from the prefix sum at right. This removes the cumulative sum of elements before left, leaving only the sum within the specified range.

-   When left == 0: No subtraction is needed, as self.prefix_sums[right] already represents the sum from the start up to right.

### Time Complexity

This efficient design reduces the complexity of each range sum query to 
ùëÇ(1), making it ideal for scenarios requiring frequent range sum calculations.
