## Leet Code 56: Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[0,2],[3,5]]
Output: [[0,5]]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4
```

**Follow up**: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## Breakdown of the Solution:
### Initialization:

Initialize an empty list res to store the merged intervals.

Sort the list of intervals based on the start index. This ensures that any overlapping intervals are adjacent in the sorted list.

Sorting example: If the input is `[[15, 18], [1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6]], after sorting it becomes [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]].`

### Iterating Through Intervals:
Loop through each interval in the sorted list.

For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last interval in the `res` list.

### Merging Intervals:

If res is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `res`, add the current interval to `res`.

If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in `res`, update the end of the last interval in res to the maximum of the end of the current interval and the end of the last interval in `res`.

This merging ensures that all overlapping `intervals` are combined into a single interval in `res`.

### Return Result:

After processing all intervals, return the `res` list, which contains the merged non-overlapping intervals.


### Time Complexity

-   Sorting the intervals list takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of intervals.

-   The merging process involves a single pass through the intervals list, which takes `O(n)` time.

-   Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n)` to store the output list res.
