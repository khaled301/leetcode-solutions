## Leet Code 435: Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

Example 4:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]]
Output: 2
```

Example 5:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[-52,31],[-73,-26],[82,97],[-65,-11],[-62,-49],[95,99],[58,95],[-31,49],[66,98],[-63,2],[30,47],[-40,-26]]
Output: 7
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= intervals.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

- Minimum number of intervals to remove .
- Which is nothing but maximum number of intervals we can should keep.
- Then it comes under Maximum Meeting we can attend.

### Explanation:

Imagine we have a set of meetings, where each meeting is represented by an interval [start_time, end_time]. The goal is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings we can attend.

-   **Sorting by end times (cmp function)**:

The function first sorts the intervals based on their end times in ascending order using the custom comparator cmp. This sorting is crucial because it allows us to prioritize intervals that finish early, giving us more opportunities to accommodate additional meetings later on.

-   **Initializing variables**:

The function initializes two variables, prev and count. The prev variable is used to keep track of the index of the last processed interval, and count is used to store the number of non-overlapping meetings found so far. We start count with 1 because the first interval is considered non-overlapping with itself.

-   **Greedy approach**:

The function uses a greedy approach to find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings. It iterates through the sorted intervals starting from the second interval (index 1) because we've already counted the first interval as non-overlapping. For each interval at index i, it checks if the start time of the current interval (intervals[i][0]) is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous interval (intervals[prev][1]). If this condition is true, it means the current interval does not overlap with the previous one, and we can safely attend this meeting. In that case, we update prev to the current index i and increment count to reflect that we have attended one more meeting.

-   **Return result**:

Finally, the function returns the number of intervals that need to be removed to make the remaining intervals non-overlapping. Since we want to maximize the number of meetings we can attend, this value is calculated as n - count, where n is the total number of intervals.


### Time Complexity:

***Sorting Intervals***: `O(n log n)`

***Iterating Through Intervals***: `O(n)`

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`

### Space Complexity:
***Sorting***:

The sorting operation typically requires `O(log n)` space for the recursion stack in the worst case when using an efficient in-place sorting algorithm like Timsort (which Python's built-in sort uses).

***Auxiliary Space***:

The variables prev, count, and `n` use `O(1)` additional space.

Combining these, the overall space complexity is `O(log n)`
