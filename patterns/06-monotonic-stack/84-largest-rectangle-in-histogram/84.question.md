## Leet Code 84: Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= heights.length <= 105
0 <= heights[i] <= 104
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

The solution uses a **monotonic increasing stack** to efficiently compute the maximum rectangle area.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `maxArea`: Stores the maximum rectangle area found so far, initialized to 0.
   - `stack`: A stack to store indices of bars in the histogram. It starts with `-1` to handle widths correctly.
   - Append `-1` to `heights` to ensure all rectangles are computed at the end.

2. **Iterate Through Heights**:
   - For each bar `heights[i]` with height `h`, check the stack.
   - While the current height `h` is smaller than the height at the index on top of the stack:
     - Pop the index from the stack.
     - Calculate the height of the rectangle using the popped index.
     - Calculate the width of the rectangle as the difference between the current index (`i`) and the new top of the stack minus one.
     - Update `maxArea` with the larger of the current `maxArea` or the area of the rectangle just computed.

3. **Push Index to Stack**:
   - Add the current index `i` to the stack.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `maxArea` after processing all the heights.

### Why Append `-1`?
Adding `-1` at the end ensures that all rectangles are popped and evaluated by the end of the loop.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Each index is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: The stack can grow to at most the size of the `heights` array.
