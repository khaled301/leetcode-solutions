## Leet Code 739: Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `ith` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

The solution uses a monotonic decreasing stack to efficiently calculate the days to wait for a warmer temperature.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `n`: Length of the input `temperatures` list.
   - `answer`: A list initialized with zeros to store the result.
   - `stack`: A stack to store indices of temperatures.

2. **Iterate Through Temperatures**:
   - For each temperature `temperatures[i]`, check the stack.
   - If the current temperature is higher than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, pop the index from the stack.
   - Calculate the difference between the current index (`i`) and the popped index. Store this difference in the `answer` list.

3. **Push Index to Stack**:
   - Add the current index `i` to the stack.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all temperatures, return the `answer` list.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: The stack can grow to at most the size of the input `temperatures` list in the worst case.
