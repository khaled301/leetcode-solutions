## Leet Code 496: Next Greater Element I

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the **next greater element** as described above.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
```

## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Next Greater Map:
-  Create a dictionary to store the next greater element for each number in nums2.

-  Use a stack to keep track of elements that haven't found their next greater element.

### Populate the Next Greater Map:

-  Iterate through nums2. For each element, if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is less than the current element, pop elements from the stack and update the next greater element for those popped elements.

-  Push the current element onto the stack.

### Handle Remaining Elements:

-  Any remaining elements in the stack do not have a next greater element, so set their next greater element to -1.

### Build the Result:

- Construct the result for nums1 using the next greater map.

Consider `nums2 = [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]`:

| Step | Element | Stack State       | Action                                        | Next Greater Map        |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    | 2       | [2]               | Push 2                                        | {}                      |
| 2    | 1       | [2, 1]            | Push 1                                        | {}                      |
| 3    | 2       | [2, 2]            | Pop 1, Set `next_greater[1] = 2`, Push 2      | {1: 2}                  |
| 4    | 4       | [4]               | Pop 2, Set `next_greater[2] = 4`, Pop 2, Set `next_greater[2] = 4`, Push 4 | {1: 2, 2: 4}            |
| 5    | 3       | [4, 3]            | Push 3                                        | {1: 2, 2: 4}            |
| End  | -       | []                | Pop 3, Set `next_greater[3] = -1`, Pop 4, Set `next_greater[4] = -1` | {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: -1, 4: -1} |

**Time Complexity**:

The monotonic decreasing stack ensures efficient lookup and updating of the next greater elements, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2.

-  Building the next greater map takes **O(m)** time where m is the length of nums2.
-  Constructing the result array takes **O(n)** time where n is the length of nums1.

**Space Complexity**:

-  **Map Storage (`next_greater`)**: Stores at most `m` entries, where `m` is the length of `nums2`. This takes O(m) space.
-  **Stack Storage**: In the worst case, all elements of `nums2` are pushed onto the stack, which takes O(m) space. 
-  **Result Storage (`result`)**: Stores `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `nums1`. This takes O(n) space.

Therefore, the total space complexity is: **\[ O(n + m) \]** where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.


## Summary

The `nextGreaterElement` function uses a monotonic decreasing stack to efficiently find the next greater element for each element in `nums1` based on `nums2`, with a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(n + m).
