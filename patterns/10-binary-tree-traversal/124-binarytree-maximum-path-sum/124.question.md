## Leet Code 124: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the r`oot of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```


# Understanding the Recursive Solution for Maximum Path Sum

This document explains the recursive approach used to solve the Maximum Path Sum problem in a binary tree. Each section provides detailed insights into the key components and a step-by-step simulation of the recursion.

---

## **What These Lines Are Doing**

```python
    gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0)  
    gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0)
```

1. **`get_max_gain(node.left)`**:
   - Recursively computes the maximum gain from the left subtree of the current `node`.

2. **`max(..., 0)`**:
   - Ensures that if the gain from the subtree is negative (meaning it would decrease the total sum), it is ignored (set to 0). This ensures that only positive contributions are considered.

3. Similarly, `gain_on_right` computes the maximum gain from the right subtree in the same way.

---

## **Recursive Nature**

- At each node, the function calculates the maximum gain from its left and right children. The recursion continues until it reaches the leaf nodes.
- The computation for each node happens **after** its children have been processed (postorder traversal).

---

## **Simulation Example**

Let’s consider the following binary tree:

```plaintext
        10
       /  \
      2    10
     / \     \
    20  1    -25
             /  \
            3    4
```

We will trace the calculation of `gain_on_left` and `gain_on_right` for each node step by step.

---

## **All Steps**

### **Step 1: Node 20 (leaf node)**
- `node.left = None`, `node.right = None`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(None), 0) = 0`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(None), 0) = 0`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = 20 + 0 + 0 = 20`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(-∞, 20) = 20`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = 20 + max(0, 0) = 20`

---

### **Step 2: Node 1 (leaf node)**
- `node.left = None`, `node.right = None`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(None), 0) = 0`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(None), 0) = 0`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(20, 1) = 20`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = 1 + max(0, 0) = 1`

---

### **Step 3: Node 2**
- `node.left = 20`, `node.right = 1`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0) = max(20, 0) = 20`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0) = max(1, 0) = 1`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = 2 + 20 + 1 = 23`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(20, 23) = 23`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = 2 + max(20, 1) = 22`

---

### **Step 4: Node -25**
- `node.left = 3`, `node.right = 4`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0) = max(3, 0) = 3`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0) = max(4, 0) = 4`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = -25 + 3 + 4 = -18`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(23, -18) = 23`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = -25 + max(3, 4) = -21`

---

### **Step 5: Node 10 (right child of root)**
- `node.left = None`, `node.right = -25`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0) = max(0, 0) = 0`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0) = max(-21, 0) = 0`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = 10 + 0 + 0 = 10`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(23, 10) = 23`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = 10 + max(0, 0) = 10`

---

### **Step 6: Root Node 10**
- `node.left = 2`, `node.right = 10`
- `gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0) = max(22, 0) = 22`
- `gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0) = max(10, 0) = 10`
- `current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right = 10 + 22 + 10 = 42`
- `max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) = max(23, 42) = 42`
- **Return**: `node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right) = 10 + max(22, 10) = 32`

---

## **Final Result**

The maximum path sum is stored in `max_path`, which is **42**.

---

## **Key Observations**

1. **Recursive Nature**: The recursion breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems (gain from left and right subtrees).
2. **Postorder Traversal**: The computation for a node happens only after its children have been processed.
3. **Ignoring Negative Gains**: `max(..., 0)` ensures that paths contributing negatively are excluded.

# Understanding the Iterative Solution Using a Stack for Maximum Path Sum

### **Approach**

- Use a **postorder traversal** (process the current node after its children).
- A stack is used to simulate the recursion and store intermediate results.
- A dictionary maps nodes to their computed `gain_on_left` and `gain_on_right`.

### **Steps**

1. Traverse the tree iteratively with a stack.
2. Use a helper data structure to keep track of the processing state of each node.
3. For each node, calculate the `current_max_path` and update the global `max_path` variable.

---

## How It Works

### **Initialization**

- Start with the root node in the stack.
- Use the `is_processed` flag to control when a node is revisited after its children.

### **Traversal**

- Push the current node's children into the stack for processing.
- Once both children are processed, calculate the contributions (`gain_on_left` and `gain_on_right`) for the current node.

### **Updating `max_path`**

- After processing a node, compute the `current_max_path` using its value and the gains from its left and right subtrees.
- Update the global `max_path` if the `current_max_path` is larger.

### **Result**

- The final value of `max_path` is returned after processing all nodes.

---

## Example Simulation

Using the same tree:

```
        10
       /  \
      2    10
     / \     \
    20  1    -25
             /  \
            3    4
```

### **Steps**

1. Push nodes into the stack and calculate gains as each node is revisited.
2. Update `max_path` iteratively based on the contributions from children.

### **Final Result**

- `max_path = 42`.

---

## Key Observations

### **Stack Simulates Recursion**

- The stack ensures postorder traversal, mimicking the recursive approach.

### **Space Complexity**

- Iterative solutions avoid the risk of stack overflow with large trees.
- The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree.

### **Performance**

- The time complexity remains **O(n)** since each node is processed once.
