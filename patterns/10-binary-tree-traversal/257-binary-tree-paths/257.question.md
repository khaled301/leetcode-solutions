## Leet Code 257: Binary Tree Paths

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in **any order**.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```


## Solutions

### Recursive Solution
**Approach**:  
- Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
- Keep track of the current path in each recursive call.
- When a leaf node is reached, construct the path and add it to the result list.
- Use backtracking to explore all possible paths.

```plaintext
     1
   /   \
  2     3
   \
    5
```


### Steps

| Step | Current Node | Current Path (`path`) | Action                  | Result (`res`)             |
|------|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1    | `1`          | `[1]`                | Traverse left to `2`    | `[]`                       |
| 2    | `2`          | `[1, 2]`             | Traverse right to `5`   | `[]`                       |
| 3    | `5`          | `[1, 2, 5]`          | Leaf node, add path     | `["1->2->5"]`              |
| 4    | Backtrack    | `[1, 2]`             | Pop `5` from path       | `["1->2->5"]`              |
| 5    | Backtrack    | `[1]`                | Pop `2` from path       | `["1->2->5"]`              |
| 6    | `1`          | `[1]`                | Traverse right to `3`   | `["1->2->5"]`              |
| 7    | `3`          | `[1, 3]`             | Leaf node, add path     | `["1->2->5", "1->3"]`      |
| 8    | Backtrack    | `[1]`                | Pop `3` from path       | `["1->2->5", "1->3"]`      |

### Why We Use `pop()`
The `pop()` operation is essential for **backtracking**:
- After exploring a branch, we need to remove the last node to revert the path to its previous state.
- This ensures that paths for other branches start from the correct common ancestor.

For example:
- At step 4, after processing the path `1->2->5`, we backtrack by removing `5` to explore other branches starting from `1->2`.
- At step 5, after exploring all of `2`'s branches, we backtrack by removing `2` to explore the right subtree of `1`.

Without `pop()`, the path would incorrectly accumulate nodes from different branches, resulting in invalid paths.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`  
  Each node in the tree is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`  
  Where `H` is the height of the tree, representing the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

### Iterative Solution
**Approach**:  
- Use an explicit stack to simulate DFS traversal iteratively.
- Maintain a stack containing nodes and their respective paths as lists of strings.
- When a leaf node is encountered, convert the path list into a string and add it to the result.
- This avoids the need for recursion and instead uses controlled memory for traversal.
