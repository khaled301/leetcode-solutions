- Searching in a nearly sorted array
- Search in a rotated sorted array
- searching in a list with unknown size
- searching in an array with duplicates
- finding the first or last occurrence of an element
- finding the square root of a number
- finding the square root of a number with high accuracy/precision
- finding the peak element in a mountain array

## Preorder: 

In this traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

## Inorder:

In this traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and finally the right subtree.

## Postorder:

In this traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and finally the root node.

## Level Order:

In this traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
