## Leet Code 230: Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `kth` ***smallest*** value **(1-indexed)** of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```


Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the tree is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 104
0 <= Node.val <= 104
```

**Follow up**: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Breakdown of the Solution

# Why Does Inorder Traversal Sort Nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST)?

## Properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST)
1. **Left Subtree**: All nodes in the left subtree of a node have values less than the node's value.
2. **Right Subtree**: All nodes in the right subtree of a node have values greater than the node's value.
3. **Recursive Property**: These properties apply recursively to every node in the tree.

## Inorder Traversal Mechanism
In an **inorder traversal**, nodes are visited in the following order:
1. Traverse the **left subtree** (recursively/iteratively).
2. Visit the **current node**.
3. Traverse the **right subtree** (recursively/iteratively).

## Why Does It Produce a Sorted Order?
- During an inorder traversal:
  1. Nodes in the **left subtree** (with smaller values) are visited first.
  2. The **current node** is visited next.
  3. Finally, nodes in the **right subtree** (with larger values) are visited.
- This traversal respects the BST properties and ensures nodes are visited in ascending order.

## Example
Consider this BST:
```plaintext
    4
   / \
  2   6
 / \ / \
1  3 5  7
```

- **Inorder Traversal**:
  1. Traverse the left subtree of `4`: `1, 2, 3`.
  2. Visit root `4`.
  3. Traverse the right subtree of `4`: `5, 6, 7`.

### Result:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7


This is a **sorted order** because the traversal processes nodes according to the BST's structure and relationships.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: 
  - Every node in the BST is visited exactly once.
  - The traversal requires \(O(1)\) work per node for processing, leading to a total of \(O(n)\) for \(n\) nodes.

### Space Complexity
- **O(h)**:
  - The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack.
  - In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height \(h = O(n)\), so space complexity becomes \(O(n)\).
  - In the best case (for a balanced tree), \(h = O(\log n)\), leading to \(O(\log n)\) space complexity.




This is a **sorted order** because the traversal processes nodes according to the BST's structure and relationships.

## Summary
Inorder traversal of a BST produces a sorted order because it:
- Visits the left subtree first (smaller values),
- Then the current node,
- And finally the right subtree (larger values), ensuring all nodes are visited in increasing order.

### Complexity Recap
| **Aspect**         | **Complexity**        |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Time Complexity**| \(O(n)\)             |
| **Space Complexity**| \(O(h)\)             |
  - Worst Case: \(O(n)\) for a skewed tree.
  - Best Case: \(O(\log n)\) for a balanced tree.
