## Leet Code 11: Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

### Notice that you may not slant the container.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:
We use the two-pointer technique to efficiently solve this problem. The key steps and logic of the algorithm are as follows:

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set two pointers: `l` (left) at the beginning of the array, and `r` (right) at the end of the array.
   - Initialize `maxArea` to 0 to keep track of the maximum area found.

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - While `l` is less than `r`:
     - Calculate the area using the formula:
       
        \[\text{area} = \min(\text{height}[l], \text{height}[r]) \times (r - l)\]

     - Update `maxArea` with the maximum of the current `maxArea` and the calculated `area`.

3. **Adjust the Pointers**:
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line:
     - If `height[l]` is less than `height[r]`, increment `l` to move the left pointer to the right.
     - Otherwise, decrement `r` to move the right pointer to the left.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop ends when the pointers meet. The maximum area found is stored in `maxArea` and is returned as the result.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `height` array. Each element is considered at most once due to the single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the algorithm uses only a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
