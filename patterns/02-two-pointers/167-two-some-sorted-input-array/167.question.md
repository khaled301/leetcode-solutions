## Leet Code 167: Two Sum 2 - Input Array Is Sorted
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Consideration
-   Array is sorted in ascending order
-   Indices are 1 based not 0 based like normal array
-   Exactly one solution
-   No same element twice
-   Solution must use only constant extra space


### Initialization:

We start with two pointers: left initialized to 0 (the beginning of the array) and right initialized to len(numbers) - 1 (the end of the array).

### Loop Until the Pointers Meet:

We use a while loop that continues as long as left is less than right. This ensures that the pointers do not cross each other.

### Calculate the Current Sum:

Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the elements pointed to by left and right: current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right].

### Check If the Current Sum Equals the Target:

If current_sum == target, we have found the pair of numbers that add up to the target. We return the indices of these numbers (1-based), which are [left + 1, right + 1].

### Adjust the Pointers Based on the Current Sum:

If current_sum > target, it means the sum is too large, so we need to decrease it. We do this by moving the right pointer one step to the left: right -= 1.

If current_sum < target, it means the sum is too small, so we need to increase it. We do this by moving the left pointer one step to the right: left += 1.

### Return Empty List if No Pair Found:

If the loop exits without finding a pair (though this should not happen given the problem guarantees a solution), we return an empty list [].
