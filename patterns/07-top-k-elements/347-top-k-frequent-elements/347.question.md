## Leet Code 347: Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
```

**Follow up**: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## Breakdown of the Solution:


## Bucket Sort (satisfies the time complexity constraints)

### Initialization:

-   Determine the number of elements, n, in the input array nums.

-   Create a list of empty buckets, where each bucket corresponds to the frequency of elements. The size of this list is n + 1 to accommodate all possible frequencies.

-   Initialize an empty dictionary, record, to store the frequency of each element in nums.

### Counting Frequencies:

-   Iterate through the input array nums and update the frequency of each element in the record dictionary.

### Distributing Elements into Buckets:

-   Iterate through the record dictionary.
-   Place each element in the appropriate bucket based on its frequency. 
-   The index of each bucket corresponds to the frequency of the elements it contains. 
-   For example, if the frequency of an element is 3, it will be placed in the bucket at index 3. 
-   Note, there can be multiple elements with the same frequency.

### Constructing the Result:

-   Initialize an empty list, result, to store the top k frequent elements.

-   Iterate through the buckets in reverse order (from highest frequency to lowest).

-   For each bucket, add elements to result until the list contains k elements.

-   Return the result list once it contains k elements.


## Time Complexity:
-   Counting Frequencies:

    -   Iterating through nums takes O(n) time.

-   Distributing Elements into Buckets:

    -   Iterating through the record dictionary takes O(u) time, where u is the number of unique elements. In the worst case, u is O(n).

-   Constructing the Result:

    -   Iterating through the buckets in reverse takes O(n) time.

    -   In total, this step takes O(n + k) time, as we might iterate over most elements to gather the top k frequent ones.

-   Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is:

    -   `𝑂 ( 𝑛 ) + 𝑂 ( 𝑢 ) + 𝑂 ( 𝑛 + 𝑘 ) Since 𝑢 ≤ 𝑛 and 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛 , this simplifies to: 𝑂 ( 𝑛 )`

## Space Complexity:
-   Frequency Dictionary:

    -   record stores at most u entries, which takes O(u) space.

-   Buckets:

    -   The buckets is a list of lists, where the total number of elements across all buckets is n + 1. This takes O(n) space.

-   Result List:

    -   The result stores k elements, which takes O(k) space.

-   Combining these, the total space complexity is:

    -   𝑂 ( 𝑢 + 𝑛 + 𝑘 ) Since 𝑢 ≤ 𝑛 and 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛 , this simplifies to: 𝑂 ( 𝑛 )

## Bucket Sort Complexity Summary:
- Time Complexity: O(n)

- Space Complexity: O(n)



## Min-Heap

### Initialize Data Structures

**heap**: 
A list that will be used as a priority queue to store elements based on their frequencies. Python’s heapq module provides a min-heap, so we'll store negative frequencies to simulate a max-heap.

**record**: 
A dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the nums list.

### Count Frequencies
Iterate through each number `n` in `nums` and update its frequency in the `record` dictionary. If `n` is not already in `record`,  returns 0, so `record[n]` becomes 1. If `n` is already in `record`, it increments its count by `1`.

### Build the Heap
Iterate through the `record` dictionary and push each element into the heap. The `heapq.heappush` function adds elements to the heap and maintains the heap property. 
By storing `-val` (negative frequency), we simulate a `max-heap` behavior using `Python’s min-heap`. 
The heap will prioritize elements with higher frequencies because of the negative sign.

### Extract Top K Frequent Elements


**result**: 
Initialize an empty list to store the top k frequent elements.

**heapq.heappop(heap)**: 
Pop the smallest element from the `heap` (which is the one with the `highest frequency` due to the `negative sign`). The `[1]` retrieves the actual element (not its frequency) from the tuple `(-val, key)`.
while `len(result) < k` Continue extracting elements from the heap until we have `k` elements in `result`.


**Return result**: Once the loop completes and res contains the top k frequent elements, return res.


## Time Complexity:
- Building the frequency dictionary: O(n)

- Building the heap: O(u log u)

- Extracting the top k elements: O(k log u)

- Since the number of unique elements u is at most n:

- The overall time complexity is O(n + u log u + k log u). Considering u can be at most n, this simplifies to `O(n log n)`.

## Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the frequency dictionary and the heap, both of which take O(u) space.

- Hence, the overall space complexity is O(u), which in the worst case simplifies to O(n) since u can be at most n.

## Complexity Summary:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)

- Space Complexity: O(n)
