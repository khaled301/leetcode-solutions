## Leet Code 373: Find K Pairs with the Smallest Sums

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Return the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]
Explanation: The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
nums1 and nums2 both are sorted in non-decreasing order.
1 <= k <= 104
k <= nums1.length * nums2.length
```

**Follow up**: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## Breakdown of the Solution:


### Efficient Pair Selection:

-   The heap ensures that pairs are processed in ascending order of their sums.
-   By limiting the number of pairs processed to min(k, m * n), we avoid unnecessary computations when k is smaller than the total number of possible pairs.

### Avoids Duplicate Processing:

-   The visited set prevents re-adding the same pair (e.g., (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1)) to the heap.
-   This optimization reduces redundant operations and ensures that only unique pairs are processed.

### Balanced Exploration:

-   The two conditional branches (i + 1 < m and j + 1 < n) ensure that:
    -   For each nums1[i], all relevant nums2[j] are explored.
    -   For each nums2[j], all relevant nums1[i] are explored.
-   This balanced exploration strategy ensures that we generate pairs systematically, starting with the smallest possible sums.

### Explicit Tuple Tracking:

-   Instead of relying on implicit heap mechanics to track the indices, this implementation explicitly tracks (i, j) as a tuple. This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.

### Why This Is the Better Solution (BFS With Heap)

**Handles Edge Cases**:

-   If either nums1 or nums2 is empty, the function immediately returns an empty result, avoiding unnecessary operations.
No Redundant Computation:

-   The visited set ensures that each pair is added to the heap only once.

**Robust for Large Inputs**:

-   This implementation can handle large inputs gracefully because it avoids creating the entire Cartesian product of nums1 and nums2 (which would be inefficient).

**Readability**:

-   The explicit tracking of indices (i, j) and systematic exploration make this implementation easier to understand and extend if needed.

### Time Complexity

**Heap Operations**:

-   The heap processes up to `min(k, m * n)` pairs, and each heappush or heappop operation takes `𝑂 ( log ⁡ 𝑘 )`. 
    -   ***Total***: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 log ⁡ 𝑘 )`.

**Visited Set Operations**:

-   Adding to or checking the visited set is `𝑂 ( 1 )` on average.
-   Total: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 )`.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 log ⁡ 𝑘 )`, which is efficient for large `k`.

### Space Complexity

**Heap**:

Stores up to `k` pairs: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 )`.

**Visited Set**:

Tracks visited indices: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 )`.

**Overall Space Complexity**: `𝑂 ( 𝑘 )`.
