## Leet Code 141: Linked List Cycle
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 4:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:
The function achieves the reordering in three main steps:

### 1. Find the Middle of the List
Using the **two-pointer technique**, the function identifies the middle of the list:
- `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
- `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
- When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` points to the middle.

### 2. Reverse the Second Half of the List
Starting from the node after the middle, the second half of the list is reversed using iterative reversal:
- Traverse the second half while updating `next` pointers to reverse the direction of the list.

### 3. Merge the Two Halves
The function merges the first half of the list with the reversed second half:
- Alternate nodes between the two halves to form the reordered list.


### 1. Find the Middle of the List

| **Iteration** | **Slow Pointer** | **Fast Pointer** | **List State**         |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Initial       | 1                | 2                | 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 |
| 1st           | 2                | 4                | 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 |
| 2nd           | 3                | None             | 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 |

- **Middle found:** Node with value `3`.

### 2. Reverse the Second Half of the List

| **Iteration** | **Current Node** | **Reversed List** | **Remaining List** |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Initial       | 4                | None              | 4 -> 5            |
| 1st           | 4                | 4 -> None         | 5                 |
| 2nd           | 5                | 5 -> 4 -> None    | None              |

- **Reversed second half:** `5 -> 4`.

---

### 3. Merge the Two Halves

| **Iteration** | **First Pointer** | **Second Pointer** | **Merged List**       | **Remaining First Half** | **Remaining Second Half** |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Initial       | 1                 | 5                  | None                  | 2 -> 3                   | 4 -> None                 |
| 1st           | 1                 | 5                  | 1 -> 5                | 2 -> 3                   | 4 -> None                 |
| 2nd           | 2                 | 4                  | 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4      | 3 -> None                | None                      |

- **Final merged list:** `1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3`.


### Time Complexity:
The function runs in **O(n)** time, where n is the number of nodes in the list.
### Space Complexity:
The function uses **O(1)** extra space.
