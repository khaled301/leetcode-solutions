## Leet Code 287: Find The Duplicate Number
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
```

Follow Ups:
-   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
-   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Solution 1: Using a Set
***Initialization***: A set called visited is created to keep track of seen numbers.

***Iteration***: The function iterates through each element in the list.

***Duplicate Check***: It checks if the current number is already in the visited set.

***Return***: If a duplicate is found, it returns that number.

***Add to Set***: If no duplicate is found in the current iteration, the number is added to the visited set.

This algorithm is efficient in terms of both time and space:

***Time Complexity***: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. Each element is checked and added to the set once.

***Space Complexity***: O(n), due to the extra space used by the visited set to store seen numbers.

### Solution 2: Using Fast and Slow Pointers
***Phase 1: Finding the Intersection Point***:

-   Both slow and fast pointers start at the first element.

-   The slow pointer moves one step at a time (slow = nums[slow]).

-   The fast pointer moves two steps at a time (fast = nums[nums[fast]]).

-   The loop continues until slow equals fast, indicating a cycle.

***Phase 2: Finding the Entrance to the Cycle***:

-   Reset slow to the start of the list (slow = nums[0]).

-   Move both slow and fast one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the duplicate number.


***Time Complexity***: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The algorithm makes a constant number of steps per element.

***Space Complexity***: O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.


## Understanding the Need for Intersection Point:
### Cycle Detection:

The intersection point indicates the presence of a cycle within the sequence.

This cycle is caused by the repeated value (the duplicate number).

### Ensuring There is a Cycle:

By moving the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer if there is a cycle.

This catching up is guaranteed because the fast pointer covers more ground and will inevitably enter the cycle and meet the slow pointer inside the cycle.

### Preparing for Cycle Entry Point Detection:

Once the intersection point is found, it confirms the existence of the cycle, allowing us to reset one pointer to the start.

Both pointers (slow and fast) then move at the same pace to find the entry point of the cycle, which is the duplicate number.

## Analogy:
Imagine running on a circular track where you and a friend start at different points:

If you run faster than your friend, you will eventually lap them and meet somewhere on the track, confirming it's a loop.

To find the exact starting point of the loop, you both start from the same place and run at the same speed. The point where you meet is the starting point of the loop.

### Steps Breakdown:
Phase 1: Detecting the Cycle:

**Slow Pointer**: Moves one step at a time.

**Fast Pointer**: Moves two steps at a time.

**Intersection**: When slow and fast pointers meet, it confirms the presence of a cycle.

**Phase 2**: Finding the Entrance to the Cycle:

**Reset Slow Pointer**: Move the slow pointer back to the start.

**Same Speed**: Both pointers move one step at a time.

**Meeting Point**: The point where they meet again is the entry point of the cycle, i.e., the duplicate number.

Finding the intersection point is essential to ensure a cycle exists and to set up the conditions for accurately identifying the entry point of the cycle, which directly points to the duplicate number.
