## Leet Code 141: Linked List Cycle
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
```

Follow Ups:
-   Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?


## Breakdown of the Solution:

### Initial Checks:

if not head or not head.next: Ensures the list is not empty and has at least two nodes.

### Pointer Initialization:

slow, fast = head, head: Both pointers start at the head of the list.

### Loop Condition:

while fast and fast.next: Ensures fast and fast.next are valid before accessing fast.next.next.

### Pointer Movements:

slow = slow.next: Moves the slow pointer one step.

fast = fast.next.next: Moves the fast pointer two steps.

### Cycle Detection:

if slow == fast: If both pointers meet, a cycle is detected.

### Return Statement:

return False: If the loop ends without pointers meeting, no cycle exists.

### Time and Space Complexity:
This code ensures that the detection runs in **O(n) time complexity** and uses **O(1) memory**, which is efficient for this problem
