## Leet Code 202: Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

-   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
-   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
-   Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

Constraints:

```plaintext
1 <= n <= 231 - 1
```


## Breakdown of the Solution:
### Concerns:
-   how to detect cycles?
    -   how to make sure we don't go into an infinite loop and will never get a happy number "1"?

### Technique to detect the cycle:
**Input = 2**

**Steps:** 
```plaintext
(2) -> (2^2 = 4) -> (4^2 = 16) -> (1^2 + 6^2 = 37) -> (3^2 + 7^2 = 58) -> (5^2 + 8^2 = 89) -> (8^2 + 9^2 = 145) -> (1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42) -> (4^2 + 2^2 = 20) -> (2^2 = 4)
```
**Note**:
In the above example, the cycle is 4 -> 20 -> 4.

So we can detect the cycle by checking if the number is already seen by maintaining a "seen/visited" set.
**Or**
We can use **fast** and **slow** pointers to detect the cycle.


## Solution 1: Using a Set

### Seen Set: 
Tracks the numbers that have already been encountered to detect cycles.

### While Loop: 
Continues until n is 1 (happy number) or a cycle is detected (number is in seen set).

### Sum of Squares: 
Converts n to a string, squares each digit, and sums them to get the new value of n.

### Time complexity:
O(nlogn) in the worst case.

Sum of Squares Calculation: O(log n) for each iteration.

Set Operations (insert and check): O(1) for each iteration.

Number of Iterations: Typically considered as O(n), but practically bounded due to cycle detection and rapid convergence.

So, the overall time complexity of the set-based approach can be approximated as O(n log n), where n is the input number.

### Space complexity:
O(n) in the worst case due to the seen set.

The space complexity is O(n) because you store all seen numbers in a set. In the worst case, this could be significant if the sequence of numbers is long.



## Solution 2: Using Fast and Slow Pointers

### Sum of Squares Helper Function:

A helper function sum_of_squares is defined to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of a given number.

### Example: 
```plaintext
For n = 19, the sum of squares is 
1 2 + 9 2 = 1 + 81 = 82 .
```

### Initialize Pointers:

slow is initialized to the starting number n.

fast is initialized to the sum of squares of n (one step ahead).

### Cycle Detection with Fast and Slow Pointers:

-   The slow pointer moves one step at a time: slow = sum_of_squares(slow).

-   The fast pointer moves two steps at a time: fast = sum_of_squares(sum_of_squares(fast)).

-   This way, fast catches up to slow if there is a cycle.

-   Loop Until a Break Condition:

-   The loop continues until 
    -   fast equals 1 (indicating that the number is a happy number) or 
    -   slow equals fast (indicating a cycle, which means the number is not a happy number).

### Check the Result:

-   If fast equals 1, the function returns True (the number is a happy number).

-   Otherwise, it returns False (the number is not a happy number).

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through an example with n = 19:

```plaintext
Initialization:

slow = 19

fast = sum_of_squares(19) = 82

First Iteration:

slow = sum_of_squares(19) = 82

fast = sum_of_squares(sum_of_squares(82)) = sum_of_squares(68) = 100

Second Iteration:

slow = sum_of_squares(82) = 68

fast = sum_of_squares(sum_of_squares(100)) = sum_of_squares(1) = 1

At this point, fast becomes 1, so the function will return True, indicating that 19 is a happy number.
```

### Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the number of steps until convergence or cycle detection.

### Space Complexity: 
O(1), due to constant space usage for pointers and temporary variables.
