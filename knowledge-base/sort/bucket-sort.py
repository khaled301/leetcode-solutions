"""
    Bucket Sort is a comparison sort algorithm that distributes elements 
    into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, 
    either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying 
    the bucket sort algorithm. Itâ€™s particularly useful for sorting numbers 
    that are uniformly distributed over a range.

    Steps of Bucket Sort
    1) Create Buckets: 
    Create an array of empty buckets.

    2) Distribute Elements: 
    Go through the original array, 
    putting each element into its respective bucket based on some criteria.

    3) Sort Buckets: 
    Sort each non-empty bucket. 
    We can use a different sorting algorithm (like Insertion Sort) for this step.

    4) Concatenate Buckets: 
    Combine the sorted buckets into a single array to get the final sorted array.
